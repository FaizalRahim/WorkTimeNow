## Pseudocode (How to use)

The owner and staff can log in, owner or admin will be able to see all of the staff details and leave taken so far. They are also able to CRUD new staff.
Staff without admin access can only update their leaves that they have taken.

## Challenges

Routes was a particular challenge and since my model has staff instead of users, it gets particularly confusing while coding.

## Future Developments

If we are given an apportunity to revisit this project, I would

1) Improve on the apperance
2) Enable to add photos on the app - Medical Certificates
